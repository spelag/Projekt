## PingPonger

PingPonger is a website for keeping track of your table tennis games.

## Hints
- To play a match go to /members/friends and select the friend you wish to play against.
- To add new friends, send out invites to users at /members/all or accept incoming friend requests at /members/friendrequests
- match requests and ongoing matches (whose results are yet to be confirmed by both parties) are found on the homepage
- To play a match in real time two players are required. If you are playing only one device, you can open an additional window in incognito mode and log in with the second account there. Alternatively, scores can be entered by editing the match.
